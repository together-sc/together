Together has grown out of the idea that it takes a community to bring up a child and to support those in need. During our years in educational settings we have seen parents struggling to find the support their child needs, professionals from different disciplines working with minimal contact with each other, waiting lists becoming ever longer and young adults moving from child services to very limited adult opportunities.  

We believe that as an eclectic team of specialists, working in a truly holistic way with short timescales Together can bridge gaps where they exist in order to help those in need. 
Offering support to families, educational settings and aiming to develop support for work and care facilities, Together can make a difference now!

If you think what we’re doing is great, please let us know!  Equally, if you think we’re missing something, please let us know that too.  We’re very happy to listen; we’re here to serve and we are committed to reflecting on and further improving our offer.  We very much look forward to working with you.
