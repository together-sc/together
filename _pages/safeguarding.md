Here at Together, safeguarding is at the heart of everything we do.  It is really important to us that the young people and families we work with are safe.  This doesn’t mean that we can do it by ourselves. We are committed to working with young people to help them be as safe as they can be, by having a voice, recognising risks and being proactive in helping themselves.  Supporting families to recognise and understand risks is also key.

With our background in schools, we are used to working within stringent policies and procedures.  That is why we are proud of what we have in place to support and protect young people, families and our team.  We also respect and follow the safeguarding policies and procedure within the schools we work with.  

If you would like any further information on safeguarding, the NSPCC have a comprehensive website.  Local safeguarding children’s partnerships also have details of procedures and contacts for specific areas:
