**About Andrea**

Having qualified as a special needs teacher in 1995 I later went on to gain a Masters Degree in Autism and Education. I have had a varied teaching career spanning both mainstream and special schools, as well as working in the specialist support teams of two different Local Education Authorities. As a result of years spent in these roles I have gained a strong depth of knowledge in regards to the holistic education of children and young people, as well as enabling parents to implement helpful strategies and mainstream schools to positively develop their provision. 
In my personal life, as a child I was identified as having Noonan Syndrome and also have a younger brother who has Down Syndrome. Growing up with my brother inspired me to volunteer with special needs social and drama groups from my early teens and into my 20â€™s. Having Noonan Syndrome means that I have a variety of specific learning difficulties, as well as some health needs that have all had an impact, not only on my life but also on that of my family. As a result I have a great interest in the education and wider social life of people who have special educational needs or rare conditions. Having grown up in a family where 2 children had significant health or learning needs has given me an insight as to how much of the family dynamics can revolve around this and how hard it can be to find appropriate advice and support when needed.
Being co-founder of Together offers the opportunity to work with individuals and families in a wider context as well as in the education setting, in order to support in a truly holistic way with an eclectic team of specialists.
