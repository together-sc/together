Are you a school, nursery, out of school club or other educational setting that is keen to improve how you work with young people who have special needs or a rare disease? 

With extensive experience in schools, particularly within the special sector, Andrea and Deb can help you. With more than two decades of experience each working with children with a wide range of special needs, including Autistic Spectrum Conditions, Down Syndrome and numerous rare diseases, we are highly skilled and experienced professionals. We will provide you with a range of high quality, enabling  guidance that is tailored to your needs. 
 Knowing that every educational setting is different, we work with you to identify what is already in place and to pinpoint your priorities. Together, we create a bespoke package that empowers you to implement sustainable, transformative changes in practice for the benefit of the children in your care.

Through varied levels of support, Together can offer consultation, coaching, mentoring, training and collaborative working for a variety of topics, including: 

* Strategic support:
	
  * Provision mapping	 
  * Planning to meet needs
  * Management of EHCPs
  * Funding applications  
  * Writing affective and highly targeted support plans, including individual education plans and behaviour plans 

*	Classroom support:
    * Developing resources  
    * Developing effective planning 
    * Good general special needs practice with positive impact on other learners
    * Scaffolding  communication and socialisation, including play
    * Early reading and phonics; meeting the needs of those children that struggle to make progress using the Synthetic Phonics approach

All our work is collaborative so will be developed in consultation with key staff. We benefit from a rich network of colleagues (including occupational therapists, speech therapists and educational psychologists) and so can pull together a collaborative view on the support a school requires. Our experience in action planning and review will ensure there is clear evidence of impact measures which can then be shared with key stakeholders, including governors.

If you think we can help, please contact us for a free, no obligation conversation about your needs. All our contact details are in the side bar.

* Working within short timeframes
* Supporting schools to audit their provision
* Facilitating problem solving founded in extensive experience and knowledge
* Providing a bespoke menu of support, working with the schoolâ€™s context, needs and budget
