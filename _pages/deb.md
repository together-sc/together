**About Deb**

It’s a bit tricky to pinpoint when I first unlocked my interest in and passion for special educational needs.  When I was at secondary school, I did voluntary work at a nursery for 2 years and always found myself sidling up to the children who I felt faced more challenges than others.  Throughout my teacher training, I opted to focus on special education wherever I could although when I graduated I first worked in a mainstream school.  In my second year I worked with a wonderful young person and family and thought ‘this is it!’ and so stepped up my intent to work in the field of special.  I became SENCo and then moved into special education, spending 20 years there as a teacher, head of department, assistant head, deputy and latterly head of school.  In each role, the difficulties faced by young people and families became apparent and one of the key challenges was availability and co-ordination of key services.  Surely our young people with additional needs in a ‘mainstream’ society should have the best of what’s on offer?  And so the concept of Together came to be.  
I am incredibly proud to be working on something I see as a positive support for special young people, their families and schools.  Whilst I bring educational and safeguarding expertise to Together, it is also very humbling to work with many colleagues who have such a wealth of knowledge and experience.  They have shaped my journey in schools and I hope the collaboration of Together will continue to provide lifelong learning for everyone involved.
